# 2poast2mote

ok apparently i have to put this here:
if you want to sell this, that's fine but let me know before you do it
and at the BARE minimum, give proper credit and don't try to put it off as your own. 
-Poastoast.

tag! you're it
it's time for the second wave of poastmote, with some notable changes
  - redesigned shape for better ergonomics
  - new custom thumbwheel for better control
  - wrist strap hole! (there will be a guide somewhere here on how to install a wrist strap)
  - more big hand friendly,,, hopefully
  - reinforced screw posts and mating surfaces

I think that's about it? have fun! as always, stl and stp files available, there's a version for each hands, buttons (and this time the thumbwheel) will be in the "accessories" branch, each new released version will also be in their own branch

CHANGES:

Top
  - [NEW] lite: same as top v2.2 but without the light holes
  - 2.2: adjusted button retainer nubs(?); changed light hole pattern
  - 2.13: fixed pcb clearance for the [RH] version


Bottom
  - 2.11: added space for the battery retainer and wires
  - 2.1: adjusted throttle wheel clearance; Added name and logo ;)
