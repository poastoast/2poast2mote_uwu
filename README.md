# backpacks

this here is the backpacks for those with bigger hands
simypy apply double sided tape to the backpack, allighn the countours with the poastmote, and apply!
there are three sizes, 4.2, 6.9, and 9.6, which each add thickness equal to the number in the file (ie 4.2 = 4.2 additional thicc)
they accomodate for the tichness of double sided tape (1mm) so they should be pretty close to true added thickness 

CHANGES:
