# 2poast2mote

if you want to sell this, that's fine but let me know before you do it
and at the BARE minimum, give proper credit and don't try to put it off as your own. 
-Poastoast

tag! you're it
it's time for the second wave of poastmote, with some notable changes
  - redesigned shape for better ergonomics
  - new custom thumbwheel for better control
  - wrist strap hole! (there will be a guide somewhere here on how to install a wrist strap)
  - more big hand friendly,,, hopefully
  - reinforced screw posts and mating surfaces
