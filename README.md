# poastmote-uwu-round-2-
tag! you're it
it's time for the second wave of poastmote, with some notable changes
  - redesigned shape for better ergonomics
  - new custom thumbwheel for better control
  - wrist strap hole! (there will be a guide somewhere here on how to install a wrist strap)
  - more big hand friendly,,, hopefully
  - reinforced screw posts and mating surfaces

I think that's about it? have fun! as always, stl and stp files available, there's a version for each hands, buttons will be in their own branch, each new released version will also be in their own branch
