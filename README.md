# 2poast2mote
tag! you're it
it's time for the second wave of poastmote, with some notable changes
  - redesigned shape for better ergonomics
  - new custom thumbwheel for better control
  - wrist strap hole! (there will be a guide somewhere here on how to install a wrist strap)
  - more big hand friendly,,, hopefully
  - reinforced screw posts and mating surfaces

I think that's about it? have fun! as always, stl and stp files available, there's a version for each hands, buttons (and this time the thumbwheel) will be in the "accessories" branch, each new released version will also be in their own branch

CHANGES:

Top
  - [NEW] lite: same as top v2.2 but without the light holes
  - 2.2: adjusted button retainer nubs(?); changed light hole pattern
  - 2.13: fixed pcb clearance for the [RH] version


Bottom
  - 2.1: adjusted throttle wheel clearance; Added name and logo ;)
